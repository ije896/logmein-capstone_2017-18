Capstone backend vision

	- DATA PROCESSING / BENCHMARKING / API KEY MANAGEMENT

		- load in creds for each w/ config file (pointers to json files), track minute usage
			- todo: confirm what our rate limits ore on video/text side
		
		- sha256 file tracking, run analysis on unanalyzed

		- (opt) compile benchmarks on set, see if our theory that duration * bitrate is the biggest predictor of processing time across diff videos
		
		- demo research: get data on tongue twister vids, targeting <30 second processing time

	- A/V THREADING
		- (should cut times by ~80% for tongue twister)

	- create readme for zach (not that much to say really)
