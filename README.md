# Presentation Helper
This repository contains the work done for the UCSB course, CS189A-B, for the company LogMeIn

- A visual and aural analyzer that helps you improve your presentation skills
- Web app (thin-client) that records you using your webcam and gives you scores and gives you recommendations for your presentation

## Module

The Video module intended to go into our MVP can be found in the ``Video`` folder. The ``playing`` folder is just me playing around with different technologies in order to build the Video module.

## How to play with things in this branch

You need to have OpenCV, NumPy and Matplot installed in your computer. You can either set up a virtual environment for this current project, or you can just install the mentioned packages using

```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
which will also install NumPy for you.

## Want more insight about what's happening here?

You can dive in into some OpenCV documentation [here](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_video/py_lucas_kanade/py_lucas_kanade.html#lucas-kanade).

Or read though some basic Python-OpenCV tuts [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/?completed=/mog-background-reduction-python-opencv-tutorial/).


That's it. For now...
