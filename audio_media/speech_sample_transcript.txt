They run, they laugh. I see the glory shining on their eyes. Not like her’s.
She seems distant, strange, somehow cold.
A couple of days after, I received the call.
I curse, scream, and cry. They’re gone. I drink and cry and dream over and over.
Why? Time drags me expanding days, months, or maybe years, but the pain still remains.
It grows. It changes me. Someone tells me she got released from the psychiatric ward.
426 days after. My head spins. I got confused. The loneliness. It’s time.
The road has become endless. I feel the cold wind on my face. My eyes burn.
I get to house, it all looks the same.
I can hear them laughing like there were no souls taken, and then she comes.
She sees me with kindness in her eyes. She looks at the flowers and she says she still loves me.
Those words hurt me like a razor blade. Goodbye my love.
